# SiS

* Forth-like system.
* Initially targeting x86-64.
* Intended to be the only system on a disk.
* Single partition.
* Minimal dependecies for building on Unix-like systems.
* Long term goal is to become self-hosting.
* Then start porting.
* Not sure if I settled on the name yet.

## PREREQUISITES

* nasm to assemble the source.
* make to automate the build process.
* qemu-system-x86_64 to try it out.
