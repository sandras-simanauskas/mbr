# CONTRIBUTING
Any sort of contribution is welcome. Even if I don't end up using it, it brings it into my field of attention and shows me what's possible. If you would like to contribute to this project please consider:
* Reducing the code without reducing functionality.
* Making the code clearer without adding comments.
* Adding functionality.
* Finding and eliminating bugs.

Again, not only these types of contributions are welcome, but off the top of my head that's what matters the most. The primary goal of the project is to keep it simple.

Also have in mind this is a public domain project - by contributing to it you are giving up all rights to the code.
