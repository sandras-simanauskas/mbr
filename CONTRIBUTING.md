#Contributing
Any sort of contribution is welcome. Even if I don't end up using it, it shows me what's possible and brings it into my field of attention.

If you would like to contribute to this project please consider:
* Reducing the code without reducing functionality;
* Making it clearer without adding comments;

Again, not only these types of contributions are welcome, but off the top of my head that's what matters the most.
